# Light Intensity Measurement using a Photoresistor with an Arduino

#### Objective:
Design and implement a system using an Arduino board to measure ambient light intensity in lux 
using a photoresistor. 
The system should accurately convert the analog signals from the photoresistor 
into a digital value, compute the corresponding light intensity, 
and display the results via serial communication.

#### Requirements:
- Photoresistor (Light Dependent Resistor, LDR) connected to A0
- Refer [this](https://docs.wokwi.com/parts/wokwi-photoresistor-sensor) for the conversion formula.


#### Sample Output
```
Lux: 39.32
Lux: 40.43
```
