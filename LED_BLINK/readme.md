# Problem Statement 1: Blink an LED with 1000ms Delay
**Objective:**
Write an Arduino program to blink an LED connected to a digital pin 
with a 1000ms (1 second) delay between turning the LED on and off.

**Requirements:**
1. Connect an LED to a digital pin 13 on the STM32.
2. Write the setup and loop functions to configure the pin as an output.
3. Use the `digitalWrite` function to turn the LED on and off.
4. Use the `delay` function to create a 1000ms pause between state changes.
